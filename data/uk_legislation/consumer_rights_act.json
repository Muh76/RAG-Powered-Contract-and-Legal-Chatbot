Goods to be fit for particular purpose\nPART 1\nConsumer contracts for goods, digital content and services\nCHAPTER 2\nGoods\nWhat statutory rights are there under a goods contract?\nGoods to be fit for particular purpose\n10\n1\nSubsection (3) applies to a contract to supply goods if before the contract is made the consumer makes known to the trader (expressly or by implication) any particular purpose for which the consumer is contracting for the goods.\n2\nSubsection (3) also applies to a contract to supply goods if—\na\nthe goods were previously sold by a credit-broker to the trader,\nb\nin the case of a sales contract or contract for transfer of goods, the consideration or part of it is a sum payable by instalments, and\nc\nbefore the contract is made, the consumer makes known to the credit-broker (expressly or by implication) any particular purpose for which the consumer is contracting for the goods.\n3\nThe contract is to be treated as including a term that the goods are reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which goods of that kind are usually supplied.\n4\nSubsection (3) does not apply if the circumstances show that the consumer does not rely, or it is unreasonable for the consumer to rely, on the skill or judgment of the trader or credit-broker.\n5\nIn a contract to supply goods a term about the fitness of the goods for a particular purpose may be treated as included as a matter of custom.\n6\nSee section 19 for a consumer's rights if the trader is in breach of a term that this section requires to be treated as included in a contract.\n\nSection 11 - Goods to match description\nPART 1\nConsumer contracts for goods, digital content and services\nCHAPTER 2\nGoods\nWhat statutory rights are there under a goods contract?\nGoods to be as described\n11\n1\nEvery contract to supply goods by description is to be treated as including a term that the goods will match the description.\n2\nIf the supply is by sample as well as by description, it is not sufficient that the bulk of the goods matches the sample if the goods do not also match the description.\n3\nA supply of goods is not prevented from being a supply by description just because—\na\nthe goods are exposed for supply, and\nb\nthey are selected by the consumer.\n4\nAny information that is provided by the trader about the goods and is information mentioned in paragraph (a) of Schedule 1 or 2 to the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (\nSI\n2013/3134) (main characteristics of goods) is to be treated as included as a term of the contract.\n5\nA change to any of that information, made before entering into the contract or later, is not effective unless expressly agreed between the consumer and the trader.\n6\nSee section 2(5) and (6) for the application of subsections (4) and (5) where goods are sold at public auction.\n7\nSee section 19 for a consumer's rights if the trader is in breach of a term that this section requires to be treated as included in a contract.\n\nSection 20 - Right to reject\nPART 1\nConsumer contracts for goods, digital content and services\nCHAPTER 2\nGoods\nWhat remedies are there if statutory rights under a goods contract are not met?\nRight to reject\n20\n1\nThe short-term right to reject is subject to section 22.\n2\nThe final right to reject is subject to section 24.\n3\nThe right to reject under section 19(6) is not limited by those sections.\n4\nEach of these rights entitles the consumer to reject the goods and treat the contract as at an end, subject to subsections (20) and (21).\n5\nThe right is exercised if the consumer indicates to the trader that the consumer is rejecting the goods and treating the contract as at an end.\n6\nThe indication may be something the consumer says or does, but it must be clear enough to be understood by the trader.\n7\nFrom the time when the right is exercised—\na\nthe trader has a duty to give the consumer a refund, subject to subsection (18), and\nb\nthe consumer has a duty to make the goods available for collection by the trader or (if there is an agreement for the consumer to return rejected goods) to return them as agreed.\n8\nWhether or not the consumer has a duty to return the rejected goods, the trader must bear any reasonable costs of returning them, other than any costs incurred by the consumer in returning the goods in person to the place where the consumer took physical possession of them.\n9\nThe consumer's entitlement to receive a refund works as follows.\n10\nTo the extent that the consumer paid money under the contract, the consumer is entitled to receive back the same amount of money.\n11\nTo the extent that the consumer transferred anything else under the contract, the consumer is entitled to receive back the same amount of what the consumer transferred, unless subsection (12) applies.\n12\nTo the extent that the consumer transferred under the contract something for which the same amount of the same thing cannot be substituted, the consumer is entitled to receive back in its original state whatever the consumer transferred.\n13\nIf the contract is for the hire of goods, the entitlement to a refund extends only to anything paid or otherwise transferred for a period of hire that the consumer does not get because the contract is treated as at an end.\n14\nIf the contract is a hire-purchase agreement or a conditional sales contract and the contract is treated as at an end before the whole of the price has been paid, the entitlement to a refund extends only to the part of the price paid.\n15\nA refund under this section must be given without undue delay, and in any event within 14 days beginning with the day on which the trader agrees that the consumer is entitled to a refund.\n16\nIf the consumer paid money under the contract, the trader must give the refund using the same means of payment as the consumer used, unless the consumer expressly agrees otherwise.\n17\nThe trader must not impose any fee on the consumer in respect of the refund.\n18\nThere is no entitlement to receive a refund—\na\nif none of subsections (10) to (12) applies,\nb\nto the extent that anything to which subsection (12) applies cannot be given back in its original state, or\nc\nwhere subsection (13) applies, to the extent that anything the consumer transferred under the contract cannot be divided so as to give back only the amount, or part of the amount, to which the consumer is entitled.\n19\nIt may be open to a consumer to claim damages where there is no entitlement to receive a refund, or because of the limits of the entitlement, or instead of a refund.\n20\nSubsection (21) qualifies the application in relation to England and Wales and Northern Ireland of the rights mentioned in subsections (1) to (3) where—\na\nthe contract is a severable contract,\nb\nin relation to the final right to reject, the contract is a contract for the hire of goods, a hire-purchase agreement or a contract for transfer of goods, and\nc\nsection 26(3) does not apply.\n21\nThe consumer is entitled, depending on the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case—\na\nto reject the goods to which a severable obligation relates and treat that obligation as at an end (so that the entitlement to a refund relates only to what the consumer paid or transferred in relation to that obligation), or\nb\nto exercise any of the rights mentioned in subsections (1) to (3) in respect of the whole contract.\n\nSection 22 - Time limit for short-term right to reject\nPART 1\nConsumer contracts for goods, digital content and services\nCHAPTER 2\nGoods\nWhat remedies are there if statutory rights under a goods contract are not met?\nTime limit for short-term right to reject\n22\n1\nA consumer who has the short-term right to reject loses it if the time limit for exercising it passes without the consumer exercising it, unless the trader and the consumer agree that it may be exercised later.\n2\nAn agreement under which the short-term right to reject would be lost before the time limit passes is not binding on the consumer.\n3\nThe time limit for exercising the short-term right to reject (unless subsection (4) applies) is the end of 30 days beginning with the first day after these have all happened—\na\nownership or (in the case of a contract for the hire of goods, a hire-purchase agreement or a conditional sales contract) possession of the goods has been transferred to the consumer,\nb\nthe goods have been delivered, and\nc\nwhere the contract requires the trader to install the goods or take other action to enable the consumer to use them, the trader has notified the consumer that the action has been taken.\n4\nIf any of the goods are of a kind that can reasonably be expected to perish after a shorter period, the time limit for exercising the short-term right to reject in relation to those goods is the end of that shorter period (but without affecting the time limit in relation to goods that are not of that kind).\n5\nSubsections (3) and (4) do not prevent the consumer exercising the short-term right to reject before something mentioned in subsection (3)(a), (b) or (c) has happened.\n6\nIf the consumer requests or agrees to the repair or replacement of goods, the period mentioned in subsection (3) or (4) stops running for the length of the waiting period.\n7\nIf goods supplied by the trader in response to that request or agreement do not conform to the contract, the time limit for exercising the short-term right to reject is then either—\na\n7 days after the waiting period ends, or\nb\nif later, the original time limit for exercising that right, extended by the waiting period.\n8\nThe waiting period—\na\nbegins with the day the consumer requests or agrees to the repair or replacement of the goods, and\nb\nends with the day on which the consumer receives goods supplied by the trader in response to the request or agreement.\n\nSection 23 - Right to repair or replacement\nPART 1\nConsumer contracts for goods, digital content and services\nCHAPTER 2\nGoods\nWhat remedies are there if statutory rights under a goods contract are not met?\nRight to repair or replacement\n23\n1\nThis section applies if the consumer has the right to repair or replacement (see section 19(3) and (4)).\n2\nIf the consumer requires the trader to repair or replace the goods, the trader must—\na\ndo so within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience to the consumer, and\nb\nbear any necessary costs incurred in doing so (including in particular the cost of any labour, materials or postage).\n3\nThe consumer cannot require the trader to repair or replace the goods if that remedy (the repair or the replacement)—\na\nis impossible, or\nb\nis disproportionate compared to the other of those remedies.\n4\nEither of those remedies is disproportionate compared to the other if it imposes costs on the trader which, compared to those imposed by the other, are unreasonable, taking into account—\na\nthe value which the goods would have if they conformed to the contract,\nb\nthe significance of the lack of conformity, and\nc\nwhether the other remedy could be effected without significant inconvenience to the consumer.\n5\nAny question as to what is a reasonable time or significant inconvenience is to be determined taking account of—\na\nthe nature of the goods, and\nb\nthe purpose for which the goods were acquired.\n6\nA consumer who requires or agrees to the repair of goods cannot require the trader to replace them, or exercise the short-term right to reject, without giving the trader a reasonable time to repair them (unless giving the trader that time would cause significant inconvenience to the consumer).\n7\nA consumer who requires or agrees to the replacement of goods cannot require the trader to repair them, or exercise the short-term right to reject, without giving the trader a reasonable time to replace them (unless giving the trader that time would cause significant inconvenience to the consumer).\n8\nIn this Chapter,  “\nrepair\n” in relation to goods that do not conform to a contract, means making them conform.\n\nSection 24 - Right to price reduction or final right to reject\nPART 1\nConsumer contracts for goods, digital content and services\nCHAPTER 2\nGoods\nWhat remedies are there if statutory rights under a goods contract are not met?\nRight to price reduction or final right to reject\n24\n1\nThe right to a price reduction is the right—\na\nto require the trader to reduce by an appropriate amount the price the consumer is required to pay under the contract, or anything else the consumer is required to transfer under the contract, and\nb\nto receive a refund from the trader for anything already paid or otherwise transferred by the consumer above the reduced amount.\n2\nThe amount of the reduction may, where appropriate, be the full amount of the price or whatever the consumer is required to transfer.\n3\nSection 20(10) to (17) applies to a consumer's right to receive a refund under subsection (1)(b).\n4\nThe right to a price reduction does not apply—\na\nif what the consumer is (before the reduction) required to transfer under the contract, whether or not already transferred, cannot be divided up so as to enable the trader to receive or retain only the reduced amount, or\nb\nif anything to which section 20(12) applies cannot be given back in its original state.\n5\nA consumer who has the right to a price reduction and the final right to reject may only exercise one (not both), and may only do so in one of these situations—\na\nafter one repair or one replacement, the goods do not conform to the contract;\nb\nbecause of section 23(3) the consumer can require neither repair nor replacement of the goods; or\nc\nthe consumer has required the trader to repair or replace the goods, but the trader is in breach of the requirement of section 23(2)(a) to do so within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience to the consumer.\n6\nThere has been a repair or replacement for the purposes of subsection (5)(a) if—\na\nthe consumer has requested or agreed to repair or replacement of the goods (whether in relation to one fault or more than one), and\nb\nthe trader has delivered goods to the consumer, or made goods available to the consumer, in response to the request or agreement.\n7\nFor the purposes of subsection (6) goods that the trader arranges to repair at the consumer's premises are made available when the trader indicates that the repairs are finished.\n8\nIf the consumer exercises the final right to reject, any refund to the consumer may be reduced by a deduction for use, to take account of the use the consumer has had of the goods in the period since they were delivered, but this is subject to subsections (9) and (10).\n9\nNo deduction may be made to take account of use in any period when the consumer had the goods only because the trader failed to collect them at an agreed time.\n10\nNo deduction may be made if the final right to reject is exercised in the first 6 months (see subsection (11)), unless—\na\nthe goods consist of a motor vehicle, or\nb\nthe goods are of a description specified by order made by the Secretary of State by statutory instrument.\n11\nIn subsection (10) the first 6 months means 6 months beginning with the first day after these have all happened—\na\nownership or (in the case of a contract for the hire of goods, a hire-purchase agreement or a conditional sales contract) possession of the goods has been transferred to the consumer,\nb\nthe goods have been delivered, and\nc\nwhere the contract requires the trader to install the goods or take other action to enable the consumer to use them, the trader has notified the consumer that the action has been taken.\n12\nIn subsection (10)(a)  “motor vehicle”—\na\nin relation to Great Britain, has the same meaning as in the Road Traffic Act 1988 (see sections 185 to 194 of that Act);\nb\nin relation to Northern Ireland, has the same meaning as in the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 (\nSI\n1995/2994 (\nNI\n18)) (see Parts I and V of that Order).\n13\nBut a vehicle is not a motor vehicle for the purposes of subsection (10)(a) if it is constructed or adapted—\na\nfor the use of a person suffering from some physical defect or disability, and\nb\nso that it may only be used by one such person at any one time.\n14\nAn order under subsection (10)(b)—\na\nmay be made only if the Secretary of State is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so because of significant detriment caused to traders as a result of the application of subsection (10) in relation to goods of the description specified by the order;\nb\nmay contain transitional or transitory provision or savings.\n15\nNo order may be made under subsection (10)(b) unless a draft of the statutory instrument containing it has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament.\n\nSection 30 - Delivery of the goods\nPART 1\nConsumer contracts for goods, digital content and services\nCHAPTER 2\nGoods\nOther rules about goods contracts\nGoods under guarantee\n30\n1\nThis section applies where—\na\nthere is a contract to supply goods, and\nb\nthere is a guarantee in relation to the goods.\n2\n“Guarantee” here means an undertaking to the consumer given without extra charge by a person acting in the course of the person's business (the  “guarantor”) that, if the goods do not meet the specifications set out in the guarantee statement or in any associated advertising—\na\nthe consumer will be reimbursed for the price paid for the goods, or\nb\nthe goods will be repaired, replaced or handled in any way.\n3\nThe guarantee takes effect, at the time the goods are delivered, as a contractual obligation owed by the guarantor under the conditions set out in the guarantee statement and in any associated advertising.\n4\nThe guarantor must ensure that—\na\nthe guarantee sets out in plain and intelligible language the contents of the guarantee and the essential particulars for making claims under the guarantee,\nb\nthe guarantee states that the consumer has statutory rights in relation to the goods and that those rights are not affected by the guarantee, and\nc\nwhere the goods are offered within the territory of the United Kingdom, the guarantee is written in English.\n5\nThe contents of the guarantee to be set out in it include, in particular—\na\nthe name and address of the guarantor, and\nb\nthe duration and territorial scope of the guarantee.\n6\nThe guarantor and any other person who offers to supply to consumers the goods which are the subject of the guarantee must, on request by the consumer, make the guarantee available to the consumer within a reasonable time, in writing and in a form accessible to the consumer.\n7\nWhat is a reasonable time is a question of fact.\n8\nIf a person fails to comply with a requirement of this section, the enforcement authority may apply to the court for an injunction or (in Scotland) an order of specific implement against that person requiring that person to comply.\n9\nOn an application the court may grant an injunction or (in Scotland) an order of specific implement on such terms as it thinks appropriate.\n10\nIn this section—\n“\ncourt\n” means—\nin relation to England and Wales, the High Court or the county court,\nin relation to Northern Ireland, the High Court or a county court, and\nin relation to Scotland, the Court of Session or the sheriff;\n“\nenforcement authority\n” means—\nthe Competition and Markets Authority,\na local weights and measures authority in Great Britain, and\nthe Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland.\n\nSection 31 - Goods not conforming to contract: what remedies are available?\nPART 1\nConsumer contracts for goods, digital content and services\nCHAPTER 2\nGoods\nCan a trader contract out of statutory rights and remedies under a goods contract?\nLiability that cannot be excluded or restricted\n31\n1\nA term of a contract to supply goods is not binding on the consumer to the extent that it would exclude or restrict the trader's liability arising under any of these provisions—\na\nsection 9 (goods to be of satisfactory quality);\nb\nsection 10 (goods to be fit for particular purpose);\nc\nsection 11 (goods to be as described);\nd\nsection 12 (other pre-contract information included in contract);\ne\nsection 13 (goods to match a sample);\nf\nsection 14 (goods to match a model seen or examined);\ng\nsection 15 (installation as part of conformity of the goods with the contract);\nh\nsection 16 (goods not conforming to contract if digital content does not conform);\ni\nsection 17 (trader to have right to supply the goods\netc\n);\nj\nsection 28 (delivery of goods);\nk\nsection 29 (passing of risk).\n2\nThat also means that a term of a contract to supply goods is not binding on the consumer to the extent that it would—\na\nexclude or restrict a right or remedy in respect of a liability under a provision listed in subsection (1),\nb\nmake such a right or remedy or its enforcement subject to a restrictive or onerous condition,\nc\nallow a trader to put a person at a disadvantage as a result of pursuing such a right or remedy, or\nd\nexclude or restrict rules of evidence or procedure.\n3\nThe reference in subsection (1) to excluding or restricting a liability also includes preventing an obligation or duty arising or limiting its extent.\n4\nAn agreement in writing to submit present or future differences to arbitration is not to be regarded as excluding or restricting any liability for the purposes of this section.\n5\nSubsection (1)(i), and subsection (2) so far as it relates to liability under section 17, do not apply to a term of a contract for the hire of goods.\n6\nBut an express term of a contract for the hire of goods is not binding on the consumer to the extent that it would exclude or restrict a term that section 17 requires to be treated as included in the contract, unless it is inconsistent with that term (and see also section 62 (requirement for terms to be fair)).\n7\nSee Schedule 3 for provision about the enforcement of this section.\n\nSection 34 - Digital content supplied with goods\nPART 1\nConsumer contracts for goods, digital content and services\nCHAPTER 3\nDigital content\nWhat statutory rights are there under a digital content contract?\nDigital content to be of satisfactory quality\n34\n1\nEvery contract to supply digital content is to be treated as including a term that the quality of the digital content is satisfactory.\n2\nThe quality of digital content is satisfactory if it meets the standard that a reasonable person would consider satisfactory, taking account of—\na\nany description of the digital content,\nb\nthe price mentioned in section 33(1) or (2)(b) (if relevant), and\nc\nall the other relevant circumstances (see subsection (5)).\n3\nThe quality of digital content includes its state and condition; and the following aspects (among others) are in appropriate cases aspects of the quality of digital content—\na\nfitness for all the purposes for which digital content of that kind is usually supplied;\nb\nfreedom from minor defects;\nc\nsafety;\nd\ndurability.\n4\nThe term mentioned in subsection (1) does not cover anything which makes the quality of the digital content unsatisfactory—\na\nwhich is specifically drawn to the consumer's attention before the contract is made,\nb\nwhere the consumer examines the digital content before the contract is made, which that examination ought to reveal, or\nc\nwhere the consumer examines a trial version before the contract is made, which would have been apparent on a reasonable examination of the trial version.\n5\nThe relevant circumstances mentioned in subsection (2)(c) include any public statement about the specific characteristics of the digital content made by the trader, the producer or any representative of the trader or the producer.\n6\nThat includes, in particular, any public statement made in advertising or labelling.\n7\nBut a public statement is not a relevant circumstance for the purposes of subsection (2)(c) if the trader shows that—\na\nwhen the contract was made, the trader was not, and could not reasonably have been, aware of the statement,\nb\nbefore the contract was made, the statement had been publicly withdrawn or, to the extent that it contained anything which was incorrect or misleading, it had been publicly corrected, or\nc\nthe consumer's decision to contract for the digital content could not have been influenced by the statement.\n8\nIn a contract to supply digital content a term about the quality of the digital content may be treated as included as a matter of custom.\n9\nSee section 42 for a consumer's rights if the trader is in breach of a term that this section requires to be treated as included in a contract.\n\nSection 49 - Service to be performed with reasonable care and skill\nPART 1\nConsumer contracts for goods, digital content and services\nCHAPTER 4\nServices\nWhat statutory rights are there under a services contract?\nService to be performed with reasonable care and skill\n49\n1\nEvery contract to supply a service is to be treated as including a term that the trader must perform the service with reasonable care and skill.\n2\nSee section 54 for a consumer's rights if the trader is in breach of a term that this section requires to be treated as included in a contract.\n\nSection 54 - Remedies for breach of services contract\nPART 1\nConsumer contracts for goods, digital content and services\nCHAPTER 4\nServices\nWhat remedies are there if statutory rights under a services contract are not met?\nConsumer's rights to enforce terms about services\n54\n1\nThe consumer's rights under this section and sections 55 and 56 do not affect any rights that the contract provides for, if those are not inconsistent.\n2\nIn this section and section 55 a reference to a service conforming to a contract is a reference to—\na\nthe service being performed in accordance with section 49, or\nb\nthe service conforming to a term that section 50 requires to be treated as included in the contract and that relates to the performance of the service.\n3\nIf the service does not conform to the contract, the consumer's rights (and the provisions about them and when they are available) are—\na\nthe right to require repeat performance (see section 55);\nb\nthe right to a price reduction (see section 56).\n4\nIf the trader is in breach of a term that section 50 requires to be treated as included in the contract but that does not relate to the service, the consumer has the right to a price reduction (see section 56 for provisions about that right and when it is available).\n5\nIf the trader is in breach of what the contract requires under section 52 (performance within a reasonable time), the consumer has the right to a price reduction (see section 56 for provisions about that right and when it is available).\n6\nThis section and sections 55 and 56 do not prevent the consumer seeking other remedies for a breach of a term to which any of subsections (3) to (5) applies, instead of or in addition to a remedy referred to there (but not so as to recover twice for the same loss).\n7\nThose other remedies include any of the following that is open to the consumer in the circumstances—\na\nclaiming damages;\nb\nseeking to recover money paid where the consideration for payment of the money has failed;\nc\nseeking specific performance;\nd\nseeking an order for specific implement;\ne\nrelying on the breach against a claim by the trader under the contract;\nf\nexercising a right to treat the contract as at an end.",
