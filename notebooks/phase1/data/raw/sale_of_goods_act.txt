Sale of Goods Act 1979

Section 12 - Implied condition as to title

In a contract of sale, unless the circumstances of the contract are such as to show a different intention, 
there is an implied condition on the part of the seller that in the case of a sale he has a right to sell 
the goods, and in the case of an agreement to sell he will have a right to sell the goods at the time 
when the property is to pass.

This section establishes the fundamental principle that a seller must have the legal right to sell 
the goods they are offering for sale.

Section 13 - Sale by description

Where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there is an implied condition that the 
goods will correspond with the description; and, if the sale is by sample as well as by description, 
it is not sufficient that the bulk of the goods corresponds with the sample if the goods do not also 
correspond with the description.

Section 14 - Implied terms about quality or fitness

Except as provided by this section and section 15 below and subject to the provisions of any other 
enactment, there is no implied condition or warranty about the quality or fitness for any particular 
purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale.
